# ECE_443
### Bradley University Class work for ECE_443 Distributed Learning Control of Dynamic Systems

Projects are programmed in Python as well as Matlab.
Projects are defined as assignments from the ECE_443 class.

### Class Description
The analysis and control of distributed dynamic systems, distributed learning and control issues in dynamic systems, distributed control and estimation of multiple dynamic systems, use of fundamental tools in modeling and control of linear and nonlinear dynamic systems, applications of distributed learning and control for multiple dynamic systems through case studies in multiple robot coordination and distributed power grids.
